# Welcome

This is the documentation for a fork of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) which has been modified to serve the requirements for Kettu.

The branch is kept up to date with discord.js:master, meaning there may be bugs present.

Currently, an implementation of Slash Commands is also included, but we decided not to use this for now and have no guarantees it will work.

This fork implments no breaking changes on top of discord.js:master.
